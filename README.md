# Sentiment Analysis of New York Hotel Restaurant Reviews

## Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is the process of automatically extracting subjective information from text data, which involves the analysis of opinions, attitudes, emotions, and feelings to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral sentences (Ain et al, 2017). 
The purpose of this work is to apply text mining techniques and sentiment analysis to explore customers’ reviews about some hotel restaurants in New York to have a comprehensive understanding of their experiences and overall levels of satisfaction, and categorize their reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Dataset
The dataset that was used for this study was obtained from a publicly available source, https://data.world/opensnippets/new-york-hotel-reviews-dataset-from-tripadvisor. It contains customers’ reviews of hotel restaurants in New York. 
The dataset contains 3,716 customer reviews with other details that includes review title, review date, hotel name, country, rating, and review text.

## Result and Discussion
By exploring text mining and sentiment analysis on the dataset, the polarity scores of each review was calculated which helps to determine whether a review is positive or negative and also measure the intensity of these sentiments. The analysis revealed that more than 80% of the hotel restaurants reviews in the dataset were positive. 
The analysis further showed that ‘Casa Barilla’ has the highest proportion of negative reviews, which represents 14% of the total reviews that was received by the restaurant.
